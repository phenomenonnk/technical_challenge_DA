some of the trends and insights from the data

some insights we can get from the scatterplots
 
consume - distance: negative exponential distribution,
for high distances we have lower consume and for small distances we have high consume but in a negative exponential way 

consume - consume: the perfect linear regression as we have the same features 

speed - consume: we can notice that in low speed we have some high consume observations, seems to be something between linear and negative exponential distribution,
it could also be polynomial, we can fit a trend line in Tableau and check what really happens. 
We can assume that the low speed is inside a city where we know that consumption is higher than outside a city
 
temperature_inside - consume: some high consume values exist when the temperature inside are 20 and 22 degrees C,
but we don't have a clear picture 

temperature_outside - consume: some high consume values exist when the temperature inside are between 4 and 14 degrees C,
but we don't have a clear picture 

gas_type - consume: sp98 gas type tend to have higher consumption than E10 

gas type air_condition - consume: some times when the car has no air condition the consumption is higher than the times with air condition.
Really weird insight but there could be some other factors that effect the consumption 

rain - consume: there is no useful insight sun - consume: driving without sun tend to have higher consumption


the highest correlation is between temperature_outside and consume: -0.318758 (negative correlation) and then with rain and speed.
So these are the most important features for consumption.


Random forest regressor and K Nearest Neighbors Regressor for k=5 are the models which fitted better the data

From tableau we cannot notice significant difference for the gas types but we can use ANOVA to compare the means of the 2 gas types and check of we have  
significant difference

No time to finish it
