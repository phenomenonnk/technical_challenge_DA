some of the trends and insights from the data

some insights we can get from the scatterplots
 
consume - distance: negative exponential distribution,
for high distances we have lower consume and for small distances we have high consume but in a negative exponential way 

consume - consume: the perfect linear regression as we have the same features 

speed - consume: we can notice that in low speed we have some high consume observations, seems to be something between linear and negative exponential distribution,
it could also be polynomial, we can fit a trend line in Tableau and check what really happens. 
We can assume that the low speed is inside a city where we know that consumption is higher than outside a city
 
temperature_inside - consume: some high consume values exist when the temperature inside are 20 and 22 degrees C,
but we don't have a clear picture 

temperature_outside - consume: some high consume values exist when the temperature inside are between 4 and 14 degrees C,
but we don't have a clear picture 

gas_type - consume: sp98 gas type tend to have higher consumption than E10 

gas type air_condition - consume: some times when the car has no air condition the consumption is higher than the times with air condition.
Really weird insight but there could be some other factors that effect the consumption 

rain - consume: there is no useful insight sun - consume: driving without sun tend to have higher consumption


the highest correlation is between temperature_outside and consume: -0.318758 (negative correlation) and then with rain and speed.
So these are the most important features for consumption.


Random forest regressor and K Nearest Neighbors Regressor for k=5 are the models which fitted better the data

From tableau we cannot notice significant difference for the gas types but we can use t test
to compare the means of the 2 gas types and check if we have significant difference

if μ: the mean of consumption for the gas type E10 and 
μ0: the mean of consumption for the gas type SP98 

Step 1: Define the null hypothesis (the opposite from what we check)
The goal in classic inferential statistics is to prove the null hypothesis wrong
null hypothesis -> H0: μ >= μ0 , means that the mean of consumption for the gas type E10
 >= μ0 the mean of consumption for the gas type SP98
we could also check as null hypothesis -> H0: μ - μ0 >= 0

Step 2: Define the alternative hypothesis
This means, what if our assumption is not true.
alternative hypothesis -> H1 (or Ha): μ < μ0, means that the mean of consumption for the gas type E10
 < μ0 the mean of consumption for the gas type SP98
we could also check as alternative hypothesis -> H0: μ - μ0 < 0

Step 3: Determine if it is an one-tailed or a two-tailed test, it is an one-tailed test.

Step 4: Decide a test statistics based on the information available.
Assuming data is normally distributed and number of observations are less than 30 and variance
is known (we can compute it), we will use a t-test.
This test is based on a "t-distribution" which is a normal distribution.
If the population variance was not known or the testing sample is less then 30, 
we use a t-test. T test is based on students t distribution which is very similar to
a standard normal distribution except that it is much flatter. Although we have 
number of observations more than 30 and if we assume that the population standard deviation is known, 
we can use z test

Step 5: Level of significance: This defines the rejection region/critical region,
it's the probability of making the wrong decision when the null hypothesis is true.¶
we will use α=0,05

Step 6: Calculate the test statistic based on the given information
we will use t-test

if p-value is p-value< a=0.05
we reject the null hypothesis and we accept the alternative hypothesis that
H1 (or Ha): μ < μ0 or the mean of consumption for the gas type E10 is significant less than the 
mean of consumption for the gas type SP98 and vice versa 

No time to finish it
